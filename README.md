# 2023: The best AI papers - A Review üöÄ [Work in progress ‚è≥]
## A curated list of the latest breakthroughs in AI by release date with a clear video explanation, link to a more in-depth article, and code.

With the creation of a whole new field called "Generative AI", whether you like the term or not, research hasn't slowed its frenetic pace, especially the industry, which has seen its biggest boom in implementation of AI technologies ever. Artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human brain and its link to AI are constantly evolving, showing promising applications improving our life's quality in the near future. Still, we ought to be careful with which technology we choose to apply.

## Neural Codec Language Models are Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers [1]<a name="1"></a>
Last year we saw the uprising of generative AI for both images and text, most recently with ChatGPT. Now, within the first week of 2023, researchers have already created a new system for audio data called VALL-E.

VALL-E is able to imitate someone‚Äôs voice with only a 3-second recording with higher similarity and speech naturalness than ever before. ChatGPT is able to imitate a human writer; VALL-E does the same for voice.
