# 2023: The best AI papers - A Review üöÄ [Work in progress ‚è≥]
## A curated list of the latest breakthroughs in AI by release date with a clear video explanation, link to a more in-depth article, and code.

With the creation of a whole new field called "Generative AI", whether you like the term or not, research hasn't slowed its frenetic pace, especially the industry, which has seen its biggest boom in implementation of AI technologies ever. Artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human brain and its link to AI are constantly evolving, showing promising applications improving our life's quality in the near future. Still, we ought to be careful with which technology we choose to apply.

## Neural Codec Language Models are Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers [1]<a name="1"></a>
Last year we saw the uprising of generative AI for both images and text, most recently with ChatGPT. Now, within the first week of 2023, researchers have already created a new system for audio data called VALL-E.

VALL-E is able to imitate someone‚Äôs voice with only a 3-second recording with higher similarity and speech naturalness than ever before. ChatGPT is able to imitate a human writer; VALL-E does the same for voice.

## InstructPix2Pix: Learning to Follow Image Editing Instructions [2]<a name="2"></a>
We know that AI can generate images; now, let‚Äôs edit them!

This new model called InstructPix2Pix does precisely that; it edits an image following a text-based instruction given by the user. Just look at those amazing results‚Ä¶ and that is not from OpenAI or google with an infinite budget.

It is a recent publication from Tim Brooks and collaborators at the University of California, including prof. Alexei A. Efros, a well-known figure in the computer vision industry. As you can see, the results are just incredible.

## MusicLM: Generating Music From Text [3]<a name="3"></a>
We recently covered a model able to imitate someone‚Äôs voice called VALL-E. Let‚Äôs jump a step further in the creative direction with this new AI called MusicLM. MusicLM allows you to generate music from a text description.

Let's not wait any longer and dive right into the results... what you will hear will blow you away!
